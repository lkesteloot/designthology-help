Reports

# What is the budget report for?

Use the budget report to create an inital budget for your project or to generate status reports for your clients as the project moves along. 

If you've entered a budgeted amount for your items at the beginning of a project, you can use the budget report as you go along to see how far over or under budget you are overall. 

The budget report will also show you the status of each item - see the [item screen](/item-screen) help section for more information about the item status field.
