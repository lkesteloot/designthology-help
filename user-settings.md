## How do I attach my own logo to customize tear sheets and reports?

To upload your own logo, you'll need a copy of the logo file in a .png format. If you've got it in another format like .jpg, you can use the "Save As" feature in most image editors (like MS Paint or Adobe Photoshop) to convert it to a .png file. The recommended maximum size is about 400 x 400 pixels.

1. Click on your name in the upper right corner of any page, then click **Settings.**
2. Under Company Logo on the Settings page, Click the **Choose File** button and navigate to your company logo file in .png format.
3. Once you've selected the file, click **Upload Logo** and you'll see the logo appear on the settings page. 

Your logo will now appear on your tear sheets and reports.
