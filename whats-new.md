# New this week: Groups!
March 30, 2015

Think of groups as folders for items that go together, for example a sofa and its fabric, or a set of draperies which might include hardware, fabric, fabrication, and installation.

When going over a project with your client, you could show them individual line items for each component that goes into the draperies:

Or you may prefer to have a single line item on the budget:

Either way, you're going to want to track the details for each component independently. Creating a group gives you that flexibility.

### Existing "old style" groups ###

If you are one of our beta users and have existing projects with "Items" and "Sub-Items", we've left them just as they were. You can see, edit, and report on them as usual, but you won't be able to add new items. If you'd like to convert these items to groups, just create a new group and drag your existing items into it. If you need help or have any questions, contact us at [feedback@designthology.com](mailto:feedback@designthology.com).
