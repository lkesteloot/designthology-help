# Links and Attachments

You can add links and attachments to your Designthology items. This is great because: 
-you use linked or uploaded images to create your own tear custom tear sheets (see Add your own Logo) 
-saved links can take you directly to a vendors webpage about the item. 
-saved attachments like vendor invoices and scans of your CFAs mean no more keeping paper in binders!

## Attach Links to an Item

1. Open a browser tab and navigate to the web page you'd like to link to your item.
2. Copy the address from the address bar.

    The type of link icon created depends on the kind of link: links to web pages will appear as a browser icon, links to pdf pages will display a thumbnail of the pdf, and links to images (.jpg, .png, .gif files) will appear as a thumbnail of the image.

    The type of link icon created depends on the kind of file you upload: .pdf files will display a thumbnail of the pdf, image files (.jpg, .png, .gif files) will appear as a thumbnail of the image. Unrecognized files types will display as a browser icon. When you click on an attachment with an unrecognized file type, a copy of the file will be downloaded to your hard drive.
