## Attach Links to an Item

3. Navigate to your designthology.com item page.
4. Make sure your item is saved, then click the **Add Link** button toward the top of the screen.
5. In the "Add Link" window, paste the web address, and click **Save.**
6. A new icon will appear at the top of the page - click it at any time to return to the linked page.

    The type of link icon created depends on the kind of link: links to web pages will appear as a browser icon, links to pdf pages will display a thumbnail of the pdf, and links to images (.jpg, .png, .gif files) will appear as a thumbnail of the image.
